# Goodix HTK32 (27c6:5335 / 27c6:5385 / 27c6:5395) libfprint Driver

A libfprint driver for the Goodix HTK32 fingerprint sensor found in the **Dell XPS 13 9305**, the **Dell XPS 13 7390**, the **Dell XPS 15 9570** and possibly other laptops using the `27c6:5335`, `27c6:5385` or `27c6:5395` USB device.

## Hardware

- **Vendor ID:** `0x27c6`
- **Product IDs:** `0x5335`, `0x5385`, `0x5395`
- **Sensor:** 108 x 88 pixels, capacitive press-type
- **Known devices:** Dell XPS 13 9305, Dell XPS 13 7390 2-in-1, Dell XPS 15 9570

Check if you have this sensor:
```
lsusb | grep -E '27c6:(5335|5385|5395)'
```

## How It Works

The sensor provides raw 12-bit capacitive images encrypted with a TLS-like protocol (GTLS). The driver:

1. Initializes the sensor: PSK exchange, GTLS handshake, config upload, FDT calibration
2. Detects finger placement via FDT (Finger Detection Threshold) events
3. Captures and decrypts the fingerprint image
4. Matches using **SIGFM** (SIFT-based fingerprint matching via OpenCV)

Fingerprint matching uses SIFT keypoints with CLAHE preprocessing, Lowe's ratio test, and pairwise geometric verification. This approach works well with the small 108x88 sensor where traditional minutiae-based methods struggle.

## Dependencies

- **libfprint** source tree (tested with v1.94.10)
- **OpenCV 4** (`opencv_core`, `opencv_features2d`, `opencv_flann`, `opencv_imgproc`)
- **OpenSSL 3.0+**
- Standard libfprint build dependencies (meson, ninja, glib, libgusb, etc.)

### Installing OpenCV

**Arch Linux:**
```
sudo pacman -S opencv
```

**Fedora:**
```
sudo dnf install opencv opencv-devel
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
```

## Important: udev Rule

The sensor exposes a CDC (Communications Device Class) descriptor that causes the Linux `cdc_acm` kernel driver to claim it as a modem device, blocking libfprint. You **must** install the included udev rule:

```bash
sudo cp 91-goodix-fingerprint.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

This automatically unbinds `cdc_acm` when it tries to attach to this device. Without this rule, the driver will fail with "Resource busy" errors after every reboot.

## Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S libfprint-goodix53x5
sudo pacman -S fprintd
sudo systemctl restart fprintd
```

This builds a patched libfprint with the driver and udev rule included. No manual steps needed.

### Other Distros: Quick Start

```bash
# Clone libfprint
git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint.git
cd libfprint

# Apply this driver (also installs the udev rule)
/path/to/goodix53x5-driver/install.sh .

# The install script will print manual meson.build edits needed.
# Apply those edits, then:

meson setup builddir
cd builddir
ninja
sudo ninja install
sudo systemctl restart fprintd
```

### Manual Integration

1. Copy `drivers/goodix53x5/` into `libfprint/libfprint/drivers/goodix53x5/`
2. Copy `sigfm/` into `libfprint/libfprint/sigfm/`
3. Edit `libfprint/libfprint/meson.build`:
   - Add to the `driver_sources` dictionary:
     ```meson
     'goodix53x5' :
         [ 'drivers/goodix53x5/goodix53x5.c', 'drivers/goodix53x5/goodix53x5-proto.c', 'drivers/goodix53x5/goodix53x5-crypto.c', 'drivers/goodix53x5/goodix53x5-device.c' ],
     ```
   - Add SIGFM static library build (before `libfprint_drivers`):
     ```meson
     opencv_inc = include_directories('/usr/include/opencv4')
     opencv_core = cc.find_library('opencv_core')
     opencv_features2d = cc.find_library('opencv_features2d')
     opencv_flann = cc.find_library('opencv_flann')
     opencv_imgproc = cc.find_library('opencv_imgproc')
     opencv_dep = declare_dependency(
         include_directories: opencv_inc,
         dependencies: [opencv_core, opencv_features2d, opencv_flann, opencv_imgproc],
     )
     libsigfm = static_library('sigfm',
         'sigfm/sigfm.cpp',
         dependencies: [opencv_dep],
         cpp_args: ['-std=c++17'],
         install: false)
     ```
   - Add `libsigfm` to `link_with` for both `libfprint_drivers` and the main `libfprint` library
   - Add `opencv_dep` to the main library `dependencies`
4. Edit root `meson.build`:
   - Add `'goodix53x5'` to the default drivers list
   - Add `'goodix53x5' : [ 'openssl' ]` to `driver_helpers`
5. Reconfigure and build

## Enrollment and Verification

After installation, use your desktop environment's fingerprint settings (GNOME, KDE, etc.) or the command line:

```bash
# Enroll a finger (8 samples required)
fprintd-enroll

# Verify
fprintd-verify
```

## Technical Notes

- **SIGFM matching** uses OpenCV SIFT features with CLAHE contrast enhancement. Score threshold is 5 (correct finger typically scores 28-24000+, wrong finger scores 0-4).
- **8 enrollment samples** are stored as raw 108x88 grayscale images. During verification, SIFT features are extracted from each stored sample and compared with the live capture.
- **Image preprocessing** removes horizontal banding and vertical striping via row/column mean subtraction, then normalizes to 8-bit.
- Thermal throttling is disabled (`temp_hot_seconds = -1`) since the small sensor generates negligible heat.
